D3 Chart Steps:

The Html part of the code just creates a div that will be modified by d3 later on.
The first part of the javascript code set a svg area. It specify the chart size and its margin. Read more.
A histogram displays the distribution of a numeric variable. So you basically need only one column in your input file.
This numeric variable is provided to the d3.histogram() function that will compute the binning and returns the coordinates of each bar.
These bars can thus be drawn using a classic .append("rect") approach.
